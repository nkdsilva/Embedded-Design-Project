# Embedded-Design-Project
A keypad based lock with SMS alert is designed in completion of module EE6304- Embedded System Design. The coding is done by using C language. Atmel Studio and Arduino IDE are used for code developing. In this design, an authourized person can unlock the lock by inserting the correct PIN from the keypad. If the password is incorrect a SMS alert will be send to the owners' mobile phone. And also the password can be changed by a authourized person.
